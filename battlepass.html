        <p>A galactic reckoning is coming…</p>
        <p>Imperial Star Destroyers exit hyperspace in formation around the Death Star, which looms with its superlaser array fixed on the BR map. Heroes from across eras are ready to strike back against the assault led by Emperor Palpatine from the shadows, and the Island’s fate hangs in the balance. Draw your lightsaber and ready your blaster May 2 in Fortnite: GALACTIC BATTLE!</p>

        <h2> An Imperial Takeover</h2>
        <p>Driving back the Imperial invasion will take every blaster and ship at your disposal, unless you feel a strong pull to the dark side…  Either way, touch down at one of these new locations:</p>
        <img src="map_image.jpg">
        <h3>First Order Base</h3>
        <p>The First Order has claimed a mountaintop to house its imposing base of operations, which includes a hangar for repairing damaged First Order TIE fighters. There are five entrances, but its utility shaft is its main point of weakness and where you’ll find it easiest to sneak in.</p>
        <img src="game_one.jpg">
        <h3>Outpost Enclave</h3>
        <p>There's an element of danger to the Outpost Enclave, a boisterous hub of smuggler activity where tensions are known to run high. While you’re in the area, check out the interior of the parked sandcrawler nearby.</p>
        <img src="game_two.jpg">
        <h3>Resistance Base</h3>
        <p>The underground Resistance command center is shrouded in foliage, hiding the facility's location from any ships passing overhead. Here, you’ll find X-wings and a ton of handy equipment for taking on the First Order’s fleet.</p>
        <img src="game_three.jpg">
        <h3>Vader Samurai's Solitude</h3>
        <p>Darth Vader Samurai has seized Shogun's Solitude and turned it into his own personal fortress. Deal with his stormtrooper samurai guards and you may get the chance to challenge the Sith Lord himself…</p>
        <img src="game_four.jpg">
        <h2>The Preferred Weapon of Force Users Everywhere</h2>
        <p>An elegant weapon for a more civilized age, the use of a lightsaber is the mark of a Jedi though it’s used by their sworn enemies, the Sith, as well. It’s handy for deflecting blaster bolts, and you'll sprint faster and can double jump with fall damage immunity while brandishing one. Lightsabers are not found but earned — you must train in the Force or, you know, just loot it off another player.</p>
        <img src="game_five.jpg">
        <p>Find and train with hologram Rey to earn a Blue Lightsaber and learn Force Push, which shoves everything in front of you. If you’re of a different persuasion, train with hologram Emperor Palpatine to earn a Red Lightsaber and learn Force Lightning, a shocking new way to deal damage.</p>
        <img src="game_six.jpg">
        <p>To use any of these Force Abilities, you must have a lightsaber equipped — any will do, it doesn’t need to be the one you earned in training. Force Abilities are tied to you and not your lightsaber, meaning that players who loot a lightsaber from an enemy or find one on the ground will not receive a Force Ability with it.</p>
        <p>Defeat Darth Vader Samurai to earn a different red-colored lightsaber and learn Force Saber Throw, which flings your lightsaber directly in front of you like a dangerous plasma boomerang!</p>
        <h2>So Anyway, Start Blasting</h2>
        <p>As far as non-lightsaber weapons go, it's blasters-only on day one! You've got your: </p>
            <div class="body_list">
                <ul>
                    <li>Reliable DL-44 Blaster Pistol</li>
                    <li>Heavy CR-2 Blaster (an SMG!)</li>
                    <li>Close-range ACP Scatter Blaster and BARM-ST12 Scatter Blaster</li>
                    <li>Close-to-medium range DLT-19 Blaster Rifle</li>
                    <li>Long-range IQA-11 Marksman Blaster Rifle</li>
                    <li>All-purpose A280-CFE Blaster Rifle</li>
                    <li>(unvaulted) Highly accurate DC-15 Heavy Blaster Rifle</li>
                    <li>(unvaulted) Empire standard Issue E-11 Blaster</li>
                    <li>(unvaulted) First Order standard issue F-11 Blaster</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        <p>Be careful about holding down the trigger, as these babies are prone to overheating!</p>
        <img src="game_seven.jpg">
        <p>Though technically not a blaster, this one will cause a blast: toss a Thermal Imploder and run away before its compression vacuum ignites for big damage, ripping a hole in any nearby structures.</p>
        <img src="game_eight.jpg">
        <h2>The Greatest Warrior of Parnassos</h2>
        <p>Captain Phasma is the commander of the First Order’s legion of stormtroopers. If you can infiltrate the First Order Base and defeat her in battle, you’ll be rewarded with the Mythic Captain Phasma’s F-11D Blaster and Phasma’s Blaster Medallion. The Phasma’s Blaster Medallion extends how long it takes a blaster weapon to overheat, and reduces its cooldown. (Cool!)</p>
        <img src="game_nine.jpg">
        <p>I feel like… like we’re being watched! Remember that Medallions make you visible on opponents’ mini-map, and the more Medallions you have, the more precise the radius of your exact location.</p>
        <h2>Pilot a Starfighter</h2>
        <p>The symbol of the Imperial Fleet, the Imperial TIE fighter is a single-passenger craft designed as an instrument of the Empire. Equipped with high-powered blasters, it can potentially be an instrument of your next Victory Royale.</p>
        <img src="game_ten.jpg">
        <p>Alternatively, hop into the pilot seat of a nimble X-wing and push the throttle to cover ground quickly! It's crucial to utilize its laser cannons, especially if you find yourself in an aerial dogfight.</p>
        <img src="game_eleven.jpg">
        <h2>May 8 - The Pull of the Force</h2>
        <p>Sensing a disturbance in the Force, Leia and Luke will arrive on the Island May 8 alongside renowned smuggler Han Solo to offer you strategic services.</p>
        <p>Speaking of the Force, hologram Mace Windu will appear on May 8 — train with him to earn a Purple Lightsaber and learn Force Pull, which pulls in just about anything and anyone nearby. Rumor has it the Sith Lord Darth Maul will be around as a hologram as well, offering Red Lightsabers and teaching Force Throw. Pick up objects around you and throw them as projectiles!</p>
        <img src="game_twelve.jpg">

                    IMPORTANT: When uploading the content to YouTube, be sure to upload it as Unlisted or Public. If you upload the video as Private, it's possible you could receive a monetization claim on your video.
